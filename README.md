# Adrestia

Due to the large amount of assets our project uses, depending on the speed of your computer the Unity project may take up to 30 minutes to first compile.
The game can be run by launching the MenuScene.Scene file located in the Assets/Scenes directory of the project. From here you have access to all content.

## Basic Controls:
* Escape: 
        
        NOTE: If running the project in the Unity editor the escape key acts as a way to exit the curser from the game screen. This might make it more difficult to shoot projectiles in game.
